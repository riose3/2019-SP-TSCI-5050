#' Please copy this file to `config.R`, edit that copy, and copy it over to
#' the working directory whenever you check out this project. This is just an
#' example of what computer-specific variables should be set. This does not 
#' actually get called by `run.R`. A file needs to be called `config.R` in order
#' to be used as a source of configuration information by our scripts

#' Do you know what character is used to delimit your files? Usually it's either
